He never quoted sutras not indulged in scholastic dissertations. Instead, his words were spoken directly from his heart to the hearts of his listeners.</p>
<p>His large audience angered a priest of the Nichiren sect because the adherents had left to hear about Zen. The self-centered Nichiren priest came to the temple, determined to have a debate with Bankei.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Zen teacher!&quot; he called out. &quot;Wait a minute. Whoever respects you will obey what you say, but a man like myself does not respect you. Can you make me obey you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come up beside me and I will show you,&quot; said Bankei.</p>
<p>Proudly the priest pushed his way through the crowd to the teacher.</p>
<p>Bankei smiled. &quot;Come over to my left side.&quot;</p>
<p>The priest obeyed.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Bankei, &quot;we may talk better if you are on the right side. Step over here.&quot;</p>
<p>The priest proudly stepped over to the right.</p>
<p>&quot;You see,&quot; observed Bankei, &quot;you are obeying me and I think you are a very gentle person. Now sit down and listen.&quot;</p>
