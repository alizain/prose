<p>Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor&#39;s cup full, and then kept on pouring.</p>
<p>The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain himself. &quot;It is overfull. No more will go in!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like this cup,&quot; Nan-in said, &quot;you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?&quot;</p>
