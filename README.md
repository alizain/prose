### A beautiful place for prose & poetry

Everyone should have access to beautiful, well written, well presented words where the thoughts and their vessel are given utmost respect. respect the prose. respect the poetry. respect the art.

could be a place for art as well, not just prose and poetry.

curated. maybe vote on which pieces to include next.

each poem should have its own, tastefully selected font?
